Grocery Sales Forecasting
Abstract
Forecasting product sales is crucial in managing inventory levels and meeting customer demand effectively, especially in supermarkets and grocery stores. This analysis focuses on developing machine learning models to improve the accuracy of sales forecasts. The challenge is compounded by factors such as new store locations, diverse product offerings, seasonal fluctuations, and varying marketing strategies. The goal is to complement existing subjective forecasting methods with robust predictive models based on real grocery store data. Multiple regression methods are evaluated to optimize product availability in stores.

Introduction
This project aims to predict product sales based on variables such as items, stores, transactions, and external factors like holidays and oil prices. It addresses the "Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting" Kaggle Competition, where the objective is to forecast stock levels to ensure grocery stores can satisfy customer needs with appropriate product availability. We approach this as a supervised learning problem, comparing various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, ExtraTreeRegressor, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XgBoost. Additionally, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and LightGBM are employed to further enhance predictive performance.
